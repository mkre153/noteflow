# üîí Security Slash Commands for Claude Code

This directory contains custom security-focused slash commands for comprehensive security reviews and automated security fixes.

## Available Commands

### `/security` - Comprehensive Security Review
**Usage**: `/security [scope] [severity] [format]`

**Parameters**:
- `scope`: `all`, `frontend`, `backend`, `api`, `dependencies`, `env` (default: `all`)
- `severity`: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `all` (default: `all`)
- `format`: `detailed`, `summary`, `json` (default: `detailed`)

**Examples**:
```bash
/security                           # Full comprehensive review
/security api high                  # API security, high severity only
/security dependencies critical     # Critical dependency vulnerabilities
/security all medium summary        # Medium+ issues, summary format
```

**Features**:
- Environment & configuration security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis (XSS, SQLi, CSRF)
- Authentication & authorization review
- Input validation assessment
- Infrastructure security checks
- Next.js/React specific security patterns

### `/security-scan` - Quick Security Scan
**Usage**: `/security-scan [file-pattern]`

**Parameters**:
- `file-pattern`: File pattern to scan (default: current directory)

**Examples**:
```bash
/security-scan                      # Scan entire project
/security-scan src/                 # Scan src directory only
/security-scan "*.ts"               # Scan TypeScript files only
```

**Quick Checks**:
- Hardcoded secrets detection
- SQL injection patterns
- XSS vulnerability patterns
- Insecure HTTP requests
- Environment variable exposure
- High-severity dependency vulnerabilities

### `/security-fix` - Apply Security Fixes
**Usage**: `/security-fix [fix-type] [target]`

**Parameters**:
- `fix-type`: `headers`, `rate`, `validation`, `env`, `deps`, `csp`
- `target`: Target file or scope for the fix

**Examples**:
```bash
/security-fix headers next.config.js    # Add security headers
/security-fix rate api                  # Add rate limiting to APIs
/security-fix validation forms          # Add input validation
/security-fix env all                   # Secure environment variables
/security-fix deps all                  # Update vulnerable dependencies
/security-fix csp all                   # Implement CSP headers
```

**Available Fixes**:
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, XSS Protection, Frame Options, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection
- **Input Validation**: Form and API input sanitization
- **Environment Security**: .env file protection
- **Dependency Updates**: Vulnerability patches
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP implementation

## Security Categories Covered

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token handling and validation
- Session management security
- Access control implementation
- Password security practices

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Security
- XSS prevention mechanisms
- SQL injection protection
- CSRF token implementation
- Input sanitization patterns

### üîí Data Protection
- Sensitive data handling
- Encryption practices (at rest/transit)
- PII data protection compliance
- Data validation procedures

### üåê Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers configuration
- CORS policy implementation
- Rate limiting strategies

### üì¶ Dependency Security
- Vulnerable package detection
- Outdated dependency identification
- License compliance checking
- Supply chain security assessment

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Security
- Environment variable protection
- Secret management practices
- Configuration file security
- Build process security

## Security Severity Levels

- **üö® CRITICAL**: Immediate security threats requiring urgent action
- **‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH**: Significant security risks that should be addressed promptly
- **üìã MEDIUM**: Important security improvements recommended
- **üìù LOW**: Minor security enhancements and best practices

## Integration Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**: Run `/security` for comprehensive review
2. **Quick Checks**: Use `/security-scan` during development
3. **Targeted Fixes**: Apply `/security-fix` for specific issues
4. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic `/security all high` reviews

## Best Practices

- Run security scans before every deployment
- Address critical and high severity issues immediately
- Implement security headers and rate limiting early
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability monitoring
- Code review security checklist integration

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Daily development security check
/security-scan src/

# Pre-deployment comprehensive review
/security all high detailed

# Apply common security fixes
/security-fix headers next.config.js
/security-fix rate api
/security-fix validation all

# Dependency security maintenance
/security dependencies critical
/security-fix deps all
```
