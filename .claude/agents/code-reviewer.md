### Manual Invocation
Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"` for:
- Comprehensive codebase audits
- Pre-release optimization
- Performance bottleneck investigation
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Code quality improvements

### Example Task Prompts

**Performance Review:**
```
Analyze the entire codebase for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Focus on React components, API calls, and bundle size. Provide specific recommendations with code examples.
```

**Security Audit:**
```
Conduct a comprehensive security review of the application, checking for vulnerabilities, input validation issues, and security best practices. Generate a detailed report with remediation steps.
```

**Code Quality Assessment:**
```
Review the codebase for maintainability, complexity issues, and code quality problems. Identify opportunities for refactoring and provide specific improvement suggestions.
```

**Architecture Analysis:**
```
Analyze the overall architecture for scalability, modularity, and design pattern adherence. Suggest improvements for better organization and maintainability.
```
